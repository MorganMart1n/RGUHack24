### RGUHack24

**Core29 Hackathon Project**

This project was developed for the **RGU Hackathon**, where participants were challenged to complete one or more of the provided objectives. Our team successfully covered **all three** objectives.  

We utilized the following technologies:  
**PHP**, **JavaScript**, **SQL**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.

## ðŸŒ± Project Objectives

### 1. COâ‚‚ Conversion and Alternatives
**Goal:**  
Facilitate the substitution of high-COâ‚‚ emission items with environmentally friendly alternatives.

**Method:**  
Each database item is linked to its specific COâ‚‚ emission value.

**Functionality:**  
The system identifies and lists alternative items with similar properties or equivalent strength/functionality but with significantly lower COâ‚‚ values â€” promoting overall emission reduction.

---

### 2. Carbon Reduction via Travel Optimization
**Goal:**  
Determine and suggest the most COâ‚‚-efficient travel routes.

**Method:**  
Utilizes public transport and geographical data.

**Functionality:**  
Implements the **A-star (A\*) search algorithm** to calculate and recommend routes that minimize COâ‚‚ emissions, prioritizing sustainable travel methods (e.g., walking, cycling, public transit).

---

### 3. Gamified COâ‚‚ Emission Tracking & Leaderboards
**Goal:**  
Encourage COâ‚‚ reduction through engagement and friendly competition.

**Functionality:**  
Tracks and assigns a **score** to users based on their overall COâ‚‚ emission reduction (lower emissions = higher score).

**Features:**  
Includes a **leaderboard system** that publicly ranks users, creating a competitive and motivating environment for sustainable choices.
